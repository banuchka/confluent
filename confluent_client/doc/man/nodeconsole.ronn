nodeconsole(8) -- Open a console to a confluent node
=====================================================

## SYNOPSIS
`nodeconsole <node>`

## DESCRIPTION

**nodeconsole** opens an interactive console session to a given node.  This is the
text or serial console of a system.  Exiting is done by hitting `Ctrl-e`, then `c`,
 then `.`.  Note that console output by default is additionally logged to
`/var/log/confluent/consoles/`**NODENAME**.

## ESCAPE SEQUENCE COMMANDS

While connected to a console, a number of commands may be performed through escape
sequences.  To begin an command escape sequence, hit `Ctrl-e`, then `c`.  The next
keystroke will be interpreted as a command.  The following commands are available.

* `.`:
  Exit the session and return to the command prompt
* `b`:
  [send Break]
  Send a break to the remote console when possible (some console plugins may not support this)
* `o`:
  [reOpen]
  Request confluent to disconnect and reconnect to console.  For example if there is suspicion
  that the console has gone inoperable, but would work if reconnected.
* `po`:
  [Power Off]
  Power off server immediately, without waiting for OS to shutdown
* `ps`:
  [Power Shutdown]
  Request OS shut down gracefully, and then power off
* `pb<ent>`:
  [Power Boot]
  Cause system to immediately boot, resetting or turning on as appropriate.
  Hitting enter is required to execute the reboot rather than another pb sequence
* `pbs`:
  [Power Boot Setup]
  Request immediate boot ultimately landing in interactive firmware setup
* `pbn`:
  [Power Boot Network]
  Request immediate boot to network
* `?`:
  Get a list of supported commands
* `<ent>`:
  Hit enter to skip entering a command at the escape prompt.
