nodegroupattrib(8) -- List or change confluent nodegroup attributes
===================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nodegroupattrib <group> [ current | all ]`  
`nodegroupattrib <group> [<nodeattribute>...]`  
`nodegroupattrib <group> [<nodeattribute1=value1> <nodeattribute2=value2> ...]`  
`nodegroupattrib <group> [-c] [<nodeattribute1> <nodeattribute2=value2> ...]`  

## DESCRIPTION

`nodegroupattrip` queries the confluent server to get information about nodes.
In the simplest form, it simply takes the given group and lists the attributes of that group.

Contrasted with nodeattrib(8), settings managed by nodegroupattrib will be added
and removed from a node as it is added or removed from a group.  If an attribute
is set using nodeattrib(8) against a noderange(5) that happens to be a group name,
nodeattrib(8) individually sets attributes directly on each individual node that is
currently a member of that group.  Removing group membership or adding a new
node after using the nodeattrib(8) command will not have attributes change automatically.
It's easiest to see by using the `nodeattrib <noderange> -b` to understand how
the attributes are set on the node versus a group to which a node belongs.

## OPTIONS

* `-c`, `--clear`:
  Clear specified nodeattributes.

## EXAMPLES

* Show attributes of a group called `demogrp`:
  `# nodegroupattrib demogrp`  
  `demogrp: hardwaremanagement.manager:  (will derive from expression 10.30.{n0/255}.{n0%255})`  
  `demogrp: nodes: n12,n13,n10,n11,n9,n1,n2,n3,n4`  

* Set location.u to be the remainder of first number in node name when divided by 42:  
  `# nodegroupattrib demogrp location.u={n1%42}`
