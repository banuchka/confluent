nodeshell(8) -- Execute command on many nodes in a noderange through ssh
=========================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nodeshell <noderange> <command to execute on each node>`

## DESCRIPTION

Allows execution of a command on many nodes in parallel.  Like noderun(8), it
accepts and interpolates confluent attribute expressions as documented in 
nodeattribexpressions(5).  `nodeshell` provides stdout as stdout and stderr
as stderr, unlike psh which combines all stdout and stderr into stdout.

## EXAMPLES

* Running `echo hi` on for nodes:
  `# nodeshell n1-n4 echo hi`  
  `n1: hi`  
  `n2: hi`  
  `n3: hi`  
  `n4: hi`  

* Setting a new static ip address temporarily on secondary interface of four nodes:
  `# nodeshell n1-n4 ifconfig eth1 172.30.93.{n1}`
