nodelist(8) -- List confluent nodes and their attributes
=========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nodelist <noderange>`  
`nodelist <noderange> [-b] <nodeattribute>...`  

## DESCRIPTION

**nodelist** queries the confluent server to get information about nodes.  In
the simplest form, it simply takes the given noderange(5) and lists the
matching nodes, one line at a time.

If a list of node attribute names are given, the value of those are also
displayed.  If `-b` is specified, it will also display information on
how inherited and expression based attributes are defined.  There is more
information on node attributes in nodeattributes(5) man page.

## OPTIONS

* `-b`, `--blame`:
  Annotate inherited and expression based attributes to show their base value.

## EXAMPLES
* Listing matching nodes of a simple noderange:
  `# nodelist n1-n4`  
  `n1`  
  `n2`  
  `n3`  
  `n4`  

* Getting an attribute of nodes matching a noderange:
  `# nodelist n1,n2 hardwaremanagement.manager`  
  `n1: hardwaremanagement.manager: 172.30.3.1`  
  `n2: hardwaremanagement.manager: 172.30.3.2`  

* Getting a group of attributes while determining what group defines them:
  `# nodelist n1,n2 hardwaremanegement --blame`  
  `n1: hardwaremanagement.manager: 172.30.3.1`  
  `n1: hardwaremanagement.method: ipmi (inherited from group everything)`  
  `n1: hardwaremanagement.switch: r8e1`  
  `n1: hardwaremanagement.switchport: 14`  
  `n2: hardwaremanagement.manager: 172.30.3.2`  
  `n2: hardwaremanagement.method: ipmi (inherited from group everything)`  
  `n2: hardwaremanagement.switch: r8e1`  
  `n2: hardwaremanagement.switchport: 2`
